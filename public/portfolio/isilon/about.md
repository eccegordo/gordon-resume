#### Code:

This project called for a simple html client side only implementation.

I used a variety of HTML, CSS, and JQuery to provide the interactive menu and dynamically load the page background. The page was a single html page placed at the root of the intranet and supported with a handful of css, javascript and image files.

One notable feature is the ability to randomly load background images and associated description text. The source for content is a folder of structureed file names and indvidual html files for the image descriptions. The page served as both a home page and a simple image gallery.
