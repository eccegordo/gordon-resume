This project required a completely custom php based application that support user management, email contact, and automated assessment framework.

I used the Symfony PHP framework with a MySQL backend. The application required a formal Model View Controller design pattern. I was responsible for the application design and backend implementation. Additionally, I was responsible for integrating the existing website design in the application user interface. A variety of components and views were developed for the specific areas of functionality in the application. A user accounts system was created that allowed the users to authenticate and complete online psychology assessments. After the user completes an assessment they are provided with the ability to view an automatically generated assessment report. This functionality required logging the assessment responses to a database. Upon loading a report view, raw assessment data is processed through specific algorithms for generating valid assessment scores. After processing the raw data, the user is presented with an interactive report with specific scoring diagrams based on their computed assessment score.
In this project I was the sole application developer. I provided PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Information Architecture and application deployment services.
