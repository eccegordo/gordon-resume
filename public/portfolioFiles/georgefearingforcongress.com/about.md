# George Fearing for Congress

About this portfolio item.

Built a wordpress theme for the George Fearing for Congress campaign website. A candidate in Washington State's 4th Congressional district.

#### Requirements:

A simple and clean theme.
Two Column design with sidebar sub columns.
Header graphic.

#### Date:

Spring 2008

#### Code:

This project required updating the theme for an existing Wordpress campaign.

I built a customized theme for the project. Created a header graphic in photoshop. The layout was based on the open source minimalist Sandbox theme framework. The theme was designed to be simple and minimalist. In addition to theme customization I configured the sidebar widget system to accommodate multiple tiers of sidebar content including a youtube channel for the candidate.
