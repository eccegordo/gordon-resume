        I build and maintain a Ruby on Rails and Ember JS application to size configurations of Isilon’s scale out NAS platform. 
        This web based application supports an international sales organization across DELL EMC. 
        Users are able to select and accurately configure enterprise NAS solutions from a potential 
        pool of millions of permutations. I took a 1.0 application and oversaw its evolution to its 
        current 3.0 release with a very small, agile team. I work with diverse stakeholders including 
        sales, engineering, and marketing to define Isilon NAS sizing needs and implement a complex 
        array of features and requirements.
